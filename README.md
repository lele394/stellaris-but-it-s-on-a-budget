# stellaris-but-it-s-on-a-budget
just a simple stellaris remake, with a python server and unity client. feel free to do whatever you want with it. updates aren't often, might be totally broken and full of exploits. Under MIT licensing.


### really just reuploaded the whole project. i don't remember any of what i've done. feel free to check it out tho.

still a few things missing. the game ain't playable yet.
Might go back to it, might not. Most likely if someone shows interest in it, this was all to test my ability to make a python server communicate with a unity c# client. 

most likely fcked but oh well
